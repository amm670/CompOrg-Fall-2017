FILES: y86emul.c, y86dis.c, y86emul.h, y86dis.h, makefile, prog1.y86.txt, prog2.y86.txt

The program runs as specified in the assignment's program specification.
It also has all the components mentioned in the program specification and
hence it successfully does the job. The implementation utilizes an array of
pointers instead of multiple switch statements. A Makefile has also been
provided in the submission which will simply make the executables for the user
and then the user can use the y86 Emulator and Disassembler as under:
y86emul <y86 input file>
y86dis <y86 input file>
