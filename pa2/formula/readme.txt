The program runs as specified in the assignment's program specification.
The formula.c, nCr.s and nCr.h files are included in the "formula" directory.
formula.h did not seem to be required as formula.c was not provided and had to
be created.

An executable can be created using:
gcc -Wall -o formula formula.c nCr.s
