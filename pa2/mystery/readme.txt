The enhancement of the assembly code was observed to store the ascertained fibonacci
sums in an array. This lessens the additional count that we need to do recursively.
For this, we proclaim an array of size n+1 and afterward round out the initial two components as
0 (when n=0) and 1 (when n=1) separately. At that point, the program loops to include the past two numbers
and stores it as next component.
